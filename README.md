It required multiple modifications in its index.html file to make more semantic elements and proper header notation along with making images contain appropiate 
alt ""  properties
Also modifying its relative style sheet. In this case style.css file to make the apporpioate sections contain the client's desired fonts and proper positioning. ALong with its in-site links to work appropiately to enhance the user expertience.
